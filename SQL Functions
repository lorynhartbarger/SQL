1. Aggregate Functions:
Aggregate functions in SQL perform calculations on a set of values from a column and return a single result, summarizing the entire set. These functions operate over a group of rows and produce a single result based on that group.
Common aggregate functions include COUNT(), SUM(), AVG(), MIN(), and MAX(). Here's a brief explanation of each:
      COUNT(): Counts the number of rows that meet the specified criteria.
      SUM(): Calculates the sum of values in a specified column.
      AVG(): Calculates the average of values in a specified column.
      MIN(): Retrieves the minimum value from a specified column.
      MAX(): Retrieves the maximum value from a specified column.
Aggregate functions are often used in conjunction with the GROUP BY or HAVING clauses to perform calculations for each group of rows.

2. Analytical (Window) Functions:
Analytical functions, also known as window functions, operate on a "window" of rows related to the current row within the result set. Unlike aggregate functions, 
analytical functions do not collapse multiple rows into a single result; instead, they provide additional information or perform calculations within the result set without affecting the overall grouping.
Some common analytical functions include ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), DENSE_RANK(), NTILE(), LEAD(), LAG(), and OVER().
    ROW_NUMBER(): Assigns a unique number to each row within a result set.
    RANK(): Assigns a rank to each row based on specified criteria.
    DENSE_RANK(): Similar to RANK(), but without gaps between rank values for tied rows.
    NTILE(): Divides a result set into specified number of approximately equal parts, assigning a group number to each row.
    LEAD(): Accesses data from the next row in the result set within the same query.
    LAG(): Accesses data from the previous row in the result set within the same query.
Analytical functions use the OVER() clause to define the window or group of rows to which the function applies.

Key Differences:
Aggregate functions collapse multiple rows into a single result based on the entire set, while analytical functions perform calculations within a window or group of related rows without collapsing them.
Aggregate functions summarize data across groups of rows, while analytical functions provide additional information or perform calculations within the result set, often used for comparative or ranking purposes.
In summary, aggregate functions work on groups of rows to produce a single summary result, whereas analytical functions operate within a window or set of related rows, providing insights or calculations specific to each row in the result set.
