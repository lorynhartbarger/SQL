/* For this project, I have three tables containing patient health care data:
PATIENTS (PATIENT_ID, PATIENT_NAME, AGE, GENDER, CITY)
VITAL_SIGNS(READING_ID,PATIENT_ID,READING_DATE,TEMP,BP,HEART_RATE)
LABS(RESULT_ID,PATIENT_ID,TEST_NAME,RESULT_VALUE,RESULT_DATE)
I will perform various health care analytics using the above tables

/* In the above query I assign a row number to each record using 
a window function ordered by age ascending. 
Then, I calculate the total number of records in the dataset. Next, I select 
the rows that have row numbers corresponding to the middle position in the data set 
and having a vital count greater than equal to 3. Finally, from my subquery, I 
calculate the average age which would result in the median age of pt with 
vital sign readings greater than or equal to 3. */
