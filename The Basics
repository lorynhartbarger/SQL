// The following notes will outline the basics of querying DB and DW using SQL

/*Basic SQL Commands:

SELECT - retrieves one or more rows from one or more tables. Ex: SELECE first_name, last_name FROM contacts; 

INSERT - adds one or more rows into a table. It only works against a single table. Ex: INSERT INTO contacts (first_name, last_name) VALUES ('Loryn','Hartbarger'); 
--Autoincrementing columns like an id column will automatically populate with an incremented number as new rows are added. Sometime used as the Primary Key--

UPDATE - modifies one or more rows in a table. Ex: UPDATE contacts SET last_name = 'Alston' WHERE id = 1;  
--if you do not specify a WHERE clause, every single row would be updated to Alston--

DELETE - removes one or more rows from a table. Ex: DELETE FROM contacts WHERE id = 3;
--if you do not specify a WHERE clause, every single row will be deleted--
